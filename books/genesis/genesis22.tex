\bookchapter{\Abraham's Faith Confirmed}

\bverse Now it came to pass after these things that God tested \Abraham, and said to him, ``\Abraham!'' And he said, ``Here I am.''
\bverse Then He said, ``Take now your son, your only \textit{son} \Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of \location{Moriah}, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.''
	\questionnote{}{If God can tell your heart (\bref{Psalm 44:21}, \bref{Matthew 9:4}), why did he need \Abraham to do this physical act to confirm his faith? Perhaps this is here to show how important works are, as it states in \bref{James 2:26}.}

\bverse So \Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and \Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him.
\bverse Then on the third day \Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off.
\bverse And \Abraham said to his young men, ``Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you.''
\bverse So \Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid \textit{it} on \Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife, and the two of them went together.
\bverse But \Isaac spoke to \Abraham his father and said, ``My father!'' And he said, ``Here I am, my son.'' Then he said, ``Look, the fire and the wood, but where \is the lamb for a burnt offering?''
\bverse And \Abraham said, ``My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering.'' So the two of them went together.
\bverse Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And \Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound \Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
\bverse And \Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
\bverse But the Angel of the \lord called to him from heaven and said, ``\Abraham, \Abraham!'' So he said, ``Here I am.''
\bverse And He said, ``Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only \textit{son}, from Me.''
\bverse Then \name{Abraham} lifted his eyes and looked, and there behind \textit{him was} a ram caught in a thicket by its horns. So \name{Abraham} went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt offering instead of his son.
