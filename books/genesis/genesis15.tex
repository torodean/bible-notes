\bookchapter{God's Covenant with \name{Abram}}

\bverse After these things the word of the \lord came to \name{Abram} in a vision, saying, ``Do not be afraid, \name{Abram}. I \textit{am} your shield, your exceedingly great reward.''
\bverse But \name{Abram} said, ``Lord \god\unskip\vmark{a}, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house \is \name{Eliezer} of \location{Damascus}?''
	\translationnote{a}{This is a somewhat different representation of the translation. Instead of the usual `\lord' used for God's proper name, the `Lord' here is the Hebrew word `Adonay' (Strong's 136 \cite{Hebrew Concordance}) which literally means \textit{lord} or \textit{master}, whereas the `\god' is God's proper name, which usually appears as `\lord'. So another way to write this could be `lord \lord', but that is a little weird in English.}
