\bverse Soo all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.
\bverse And Enoch walked with God; and he \was not, for God took him.
	\questionnote{}{This scripture breaks the pattern seen with all the other members of this genealogy. With the others, their total days are numbered and they eventually die. However, with Enoch, it simply says `God took him' \textit{instead} of `he died.' What does this mean? Does this mean that God took him to another place, or that God took him in death early? Perhaps this can be a distinction between dying of old age (like the others) and dying of unnatural causes (in this case). This somehow has to fit with \bref{Hebrews 9:27} and \bref{John 3:13}.}

  \caption{This is a diagram showing the genealogy of the family of Adam\index{Adam}'s as outlined in \bref{Genesis 4} and \bref{Genesis 5}. It ends with Noah\index{Noah}'s three children. Males are depicted in blue, while females are pink. Births are depicted as branching off from the mother. Marriages are depicted with a rectangular border around the couple. The genealogy between Seth\index{Seth} and Noah\index{Noah} have timeline markers showing the year of birth and death (death is shown for most, but not all). Enoch (yellow) is a somewhat special case here as it does not explicitly say when/if he died (see \bref{Genesis 5:24}). This diagram was created by me using the draw.io tool \cite{draw.io}.}
