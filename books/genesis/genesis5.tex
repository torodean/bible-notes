\bverse This is the book of the genealogy\vmark{a} of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in the likeness of God.
	\contextnote{a}{Only the names of those leading to the genealogy of Noah are given. The others are not mentioned, but it is implied they exist in \bref{Genesis 5:4}, \bref{Genesis 5:7}, \bref{Genesis 5:10} and other scriptures.}

\bverse He created them male and female, and blessed them and called them Mankind in the day they were created.
\bverse And Adam\vmark{a} lived one hundred and thirty years, and begot \textit{a son} in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.

  \caption{This is a diagram showing the genealogy of the family of Adam's as outlined in \bref{Genesis 4} and \bref{Genesis 5}. It ends with Noah's three children. Males are depicted in blue, while females are pink. Births are depicted as branching off from the mother. Marriages are depicted with a rectangular border around the couple. The genealogy between Seth and Noah have timeline markers showing the year of birth and death (death is shown for most, but not all). This diagram was created by me using the draw.io tool \cite{draw.io}.}
