\bverse Soo all the days of \name{Enoch} were three hundred and sixty-five years.
\bverse And \name{Enoch} walked with God; and he \was not, for God took him.
	\questionnote{}{This scripture breaks the pattern seen with all the other members of this genealogy. With the others, their total days are numbered and they eventually die. However, with \name{Enoch}, it simply says `God took him' \textit{instead} of `he died.' What does this mean? Does this mean that God took him to another place, or that God took him in death early? Perhaps this can be a distinction between dying of old age (like the others) and dying of unnatural causes (in this case). This somehow has to fit with \bref{Hebrews 9:27} and \bref{John 3:13}.}

	\translationnote{a}{The word/name `\name{Noah}' (Strong's 5146\cite{Strong's GodRules}) means `rest.'}

  \caption{This is a diagram showing the genealogy of the family of \Adam's as outlined in \bref{Genesis 4} and \bref{Genesis 5}. It ends with \name{Noah}'s three children. Males are depicted in blue, while females are pink. Births are depicted as branching off from the mother. Marriages are depicted with a rectangular border around the couple. The genealogy between \name{Seth} and \name{Noah} have timeline markers showing the year of birth and death (death is shown for most, but not all). \name{Enoch} (yellow) is a somewhat special case here as it does not explicitly say when/if he died (see \bref{Genesis 5:24}). This diagram was created by me using the draw.io tool \cite{draw.io}.}
