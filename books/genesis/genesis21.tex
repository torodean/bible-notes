\bookchapter{\name{Isaac} Is Born}

\bverse And the \lord visited \name{Sarah} as He had said, and the \lord did for \name{Sarah} as He had spoken.
\bverse For \name{Sarah} conceived and bore \name{Abraham} a son in his old age, at the set time which God had spoken to him.
\bverse And \name{Abraham} called the name of his son who was born to him--whom \name{Sarah} bore to him--\name{Isaac}. 
\bverse Then \name{Abraham} circumcised his son \name{Isaac} when he was eight days old\vmark{a}, as God had commanded him.
	\generalnote{a}{Circumcision was to be done on the eighth day.}

\bverse Now \name{Abraham} was one hundred years old when his son \name{Isaac} was born to him.
\bverse And \name{Sarah} said, ``God has made me laugh, \textit{and} all who hear will laugh with me.''
\bverse She also said, ``Who would have said to \name{Abraham} that \name{Sarah} would nurse children? For I have borne \textit{him} a son in his old age.''

\bverse So the child grew and was weaned. And \name{Abraham} made a great feast on the same day that \name{Isaac} was weaned.
\bverse And \name{Sarah} saw the son of \name{Hagar} the \people{Egyptian}, whom she had borne to \name{Abraham}, scoffing.
\bverse Therefore she said to \name{Abraham}, ``Cast out this bondwomen and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, \textit{namely} with \name{Isaac}.''
\bverse And the matter was very displeasing in \name{Abraham}'s sight because of his son.
