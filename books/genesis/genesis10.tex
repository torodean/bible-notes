\bookchapter{Nations Descended from Noah}

\bverse Now this \textit{is} the genealogy of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood.
\bverse The sons of Japheth \were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
\bverse The sons of Gomer \were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
\bverse The sons of Javan \were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
\bverse From these the coastland \textit{peoples} of the Gentiles were separated into their lands, everyone according to his tongue\vmark{a}, according to their families, into their nations.
	\translationnote{a}{The word for `tongue' here (Strong's 3956 \cite{Strong's GodRules}) is often translated as language, but is distinct from the term for language used in \bref{Genesis 11:1} (thus translated to tongue here). this means tongue (literal or \textit{organ of speech}), language, etc. It could refer to various dialects, or different languages entirely.}

\bverse The sons of Ham \were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.

\bverse And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; then as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
\bverse These \were the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their tongues, in their lands \textit{and} in their nations.
\bverse And \textit{children} were born also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder\vmark{a}.
