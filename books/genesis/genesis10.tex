\bookchapter{Nations Descended from Noah}

\bverse Now this \textit{is} the genealogy of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And sons were born to them after the flood.
\bverse The sons of Japheth \textit{were} Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
\bverse The sons of Gomer \textit{were} Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
\bverse The sons of Javan \textit{were} Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
\bverse From these the coastland \textit{peoples} of the Gentiles were separated into their lands, everyone according to his language, according to their families, into their nations.
\bverse The sons of Ham \textit{were} Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
\bverse The sons of Cush \textit{were} Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtechah; and the sons of Raamah \textit{were} Sheba and Dedan.
\bverse Cush begot Nimrod; he began to be a mighty one on the earth.
\bverse He was a mighty hunter before the \lord; therefore it is said, ``Like Nimrod the mighty hunter before the \lord.
\bverse And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
\bverse From that land he went to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,
\bverse and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (that \textit{is} the principal city).
\bverse Mizraim begot Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,
\bverse Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom came the Philistines and Caphtorim).
\bverse Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Heth;
\bverse the Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgashite;
\bverse The Hivite, the Arkite, and the Sinite;
\bverse The Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were dispersed.
\bverse And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon as you go toward Gerar, as far as Gaza; then as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
\bverse These \textit{were} the sons of Ham, according to their families, according to their languages, in their lands \textit{and} in their nations.
