\bookchapter{\location{Sodom}'s Depravity}

\bverse Now the two angels came to \location{Sodom} in the evening, and \name{Lot} was sitting in the gate of \location{Sodom}. When \name{Lot} saw \textit{them}, he rose to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground.
\bverse And he said, ``Here now, my lords, please turn in to your servant's house and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.'' And they said, ``No, but we will spend the night in the open square.''
\bverse But he insisted strongly; so they turned in to him and entered his house. Then he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate\vmark{a}.
	\generalnote{a}{Here the angels eat food. Which humanizes them and demonstrates that they can do things that normal humans do like interacting with the physical and eating.}

\bverse Now before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of \location{Sodom}, both old and young, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house.
\bverse And they called to \name{Lot} and said to him, ``Where are the men\vmark{a} who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may know them \textit{carnally}.''
	\generalnote{a}{The townsfolk recognize these as men, despite them being angels. This further demonstrates that angels can appear as human.}
	\questionnote{}{Are there humans around us which are actually angels interacting with us? This is certainly suggested in \bref{Hebrews 13:2}.}

\bverse So \name{Lot} went out to them through the doorway, shut the door behind him, 
\bverse and said, ``Please, my brethren, do not do so wickedly! 
\bverse See now, I have two daughters who have not known a man; please, let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as you wish; only do nothing to these men, since this is the reason they have come under the shadow of my roof.''
	\contextnote{}{Offering his two daughters to the mob is such an extreme act. This could demonstrate that \name{Lot} recognizes that the men are angels sent from God and perhaps he thinks that if the acts of the mob are carried out, that God's wrath will be sent down on them. Otherwise, why would he offer such an extreme counter offer in response?}

\bverse And they said, ``Stand back!'' Then they said, ``This one came in to stay \textit{here}, and he keeps acting as a judge; now we will deal worse with you than with them.''So they pressed hard against the man \name{Lot}, and came near to break down the door.
\bverse But the men reached out their hands and pulled \name{Lot} into the house with them, and shut the door.
\bverse And they struck the men who \were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they became weary \textit{trying} to find the door.
