% Chapter 6 of Genesis
\bookchapter{The Wickedness And Judgment\index{Judgment} of Man}


\bverse Now it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth\index{Earth}, and daughters were born to them,
\bverse that the sons\vmark{a} of God saw the daughters of men, that they \textit{were} beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.
	\translationnote{a}{The word `sons' here (Strong's 1121\cite{Strong's GodRules}) means children, people, grandsons, youth, etc. Since Adam\index{Adam} was directly created by God, any of his descendants could fall into this category. The `sons of God' distinction could be used to specifically refer to people who were following Gods and not those who strayed from his ways.}

\bverse And the \lord said, ``My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he \textit{is} indeed flesh; yet his days shall be one hundred and twenty years.''
\bverse There were giants\vmark{a} on the earth\index{Earth} in those days, and also afterward\vmark{b}, when the sons of God\vmark{c} came in to the daughters of men and they bore \textit{children} to them.
	\translationnote{a}{This term for `giant' (Strong's 5303\cite{Strong's GodRules}), is also known as `the Nephilim' has a bit of debate around it. Regardless, it means that there were a group of people with unusually large size and strength.}
	\contextnote{b}{This is likely referring to after the flood, since we also see giants mentioned after this time period in \bref{Numbers 13:33}.}
	\philosophicalnote{c}{Some argue that the `sons of God' here is angels (or demons), and thus the spirit beings created offspring with humans. The word for sons here does not really fit that at all (see the note on \bref{Genesis 6:2}).}

\bverse Those \textit{were} the mighty men who \textit{were} of old, men of renown.
