\bookchapter{\name{Lot}'s Captivity and Rescue}

\bverse And it came to pass in the days of \name{Amraphel} king of Shinar, \name{Arioch} king of Ellasar, \name{Chedorlaomer} king of Elam, and \name{Tidal} king of nations, 
\bverse \that they made war with \name{Bera} king of Sodom, \name{Birsha} king of Gomorrah, \name{Shinab} king of Admah, \name{Shemeber} king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, \name{Zoar}).
\bverse All these joined together in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea).
\bverse Twelve years they served \name{Chedorlaomer}, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
\bverse In the fourteenth year, \name{Chedorlaomer} and the kings that \were with him came and attacked the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,
\bverse and the Horites in their mountain of Seir, as far as El Paran, which \is by the wilderness.
\bverse Then they turned back adn came to En Mishpat (that \is, Kadesh), and attacked all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon Tamar.

\bverse And the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the kings of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that \is, \name{Zoar}) went out and joined together in battle in the Valley of Siddim
\bverse against \name{Chedorlaomer} king of Elam, \name{Tidal} king of nations, \name{Amraphel} king of Shinar, and \name{Arioch} king of Ellasar--four kings against five.
\bverse Now the Valley of Siddim \textit{was full of} asphalt pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled; \textit{some} fell there, and the remainder fled to the mountains.
\bverse Then they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way.
\bverse They also took \name{Lot}, \name{Abram};s brother's son who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
\bverse Then one who had escaped came and told \name{Abram} the Hebrew, for he dwelt by the terebinth trees of \name{Mamre} the Amorite, brother of \name{Eshcol} and brother of \name{Aner}; and they \were allies with \name{Abram}.
\bverse Now when \name{Abram} heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his three hundred and eighteen trained \textit{servants} who were born in his own house, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
\bverse He divided his forces against them by night, and he and his servants attacked them and pursued them as far as Hobah, which \is north of Damascus.
\bverse So he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother \name{Lot} and his goods, as well as the women and the people.
\bverse And the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that \is, the King's Valley), after his return from the defeat of \name{Chedorlaomer} and the kings who \were with him.
