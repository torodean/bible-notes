% Chapter 2 of Genesis
\bookchapter{The Garden of Eden}


\bverse{Thus the heavens\index{Heaven} and the earth\index{Earth}, and all the host of them, were finished.}
	\generalnote{}{This scripture, which directly follows the concluding creation of earth\index{Earth} and man, could mean that these described creation events were the last event needed for God to have fulfilled what he was making. If a \textit{gap-theory} is correct, this implies that the earth\index{Earth} was the final stone to place. If not, then it could have just been that this simply concludes the creation.}
