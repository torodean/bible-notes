% Chapter 2 of Genesis
\bookchapter{The Garden of Eden}


\bverse{Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished.}
	\generalnote{}{This scripture, which directly follows the concluding creation of earth and man, could mean that these described creation events were the last event needed for God to have fulfilled what he was making. If a \textit{gap-theory} is correct, this implies that the earth was the final stone to place. If not, then it could have just been that this simply concludes the creation.}
