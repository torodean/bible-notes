\bookchapter{The History of Creation}

\bverse{In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.}

\bverse{The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.}

\bverse{Then God said, ``Let there be light"; and there was light.}

\bverse{And God saw the light, \textit{that it} was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.}

\bverse{God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.}
