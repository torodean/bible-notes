\bookchapter{Introduction and Benediction}

\bverse The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His servants--things which must shortly take place. And He sent and signified \textit{it} by His angel to His servant John,
\bverse who bore witness to the word of God, and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to all things that he saw.
\bverse Blessed \textit{is} he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it: for the time \textit{is} near.

\bmarkerdown{Greeting the Seven Churches}

\bverse John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grave to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne,
\bverse and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood,
\bverse and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him \textit{be} glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
\bverse Behold, He is coming with clouds, and every eye will see Him, even they who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him. Even so, Amen.
