\chapter{Operations During Services}

\section{Checks And Tests Before Services Start}

The following are helpful things to test before services begin.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
	\item Play a few seconds (or more if needed) of a hymn to ensure that the sound comes out of the room speakers and not the laptop speakers.
	\item Have the song leader do a sound check at the podium. Adjust volumes on the sound board at this time.
	\begin{caution}
		The sound board in the building we use requires the gain for the podium mic to be almost maxed out (98\% or so). Be careful when adjusting this as it requires very fine adjustments and may cause loud speaker feedback if adjusted too high and no sound if adjusted too low. 
	\end{caution}
	\item If you have a separate device, sign into the Zoom and ensure that the sound is coming through okay.
	\item Double check the hymn slide numbers and make sure they go to the correct slides. Sometimes slides can be accidentally added so this is good to check beforehand in case adjustments need made.
	\item Ensure that the camera image is displayed and Zoom is un-muted. Also ensure that all guests are muted.
\end{enumerate}

\section{First Hymn}

All UCG services start typically with a hymn. 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
	\item With the hymn slides screen selected, enter the correct slide number for the first hymn, and press enter. It should navigate to the appropriate slide for the first hymn.
	\item Share the Hymnal slides screen in Zoom (use the share screen button). Ensure that \textit{share sound} is selected (this only needs done the first time or if Zoom crashes/restarts).
	\item Un-mute both the song leader and the computer audio on the sound board.
	\item When the song leader signals, start the first hymn in VLC by double clicking it, or selecting it and pressing play. Mute the speaker at the same time.
	\item Select the hymn slides window and progress through the slides as the song progresses (using the right arrow key). Try to continue to the next slide just before the last syllable of the last word on the current slide is sung for a smooth transition for the singers.
	\item When the song ends, VLC will automatically stop and not play the next hymn. Un-mute the song leader just as the song ends.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Second Hymn}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
	\item With the hymn slides screen selected, enter the correct slide number for the next hymn, and press enter. It should navigate to the appropriate slide for the next hymn.

		\end{enumerate}
	\item Start the sermonette timer and place it in clear view of the speaker.
	\item After the speaker finishes, \textit{pause} the recording (don't stop it).
