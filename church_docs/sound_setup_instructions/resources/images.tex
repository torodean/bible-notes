    \caption{This is an image of the camera setup. Notice that the red HMDI cable is tied to the leg of the tripod so that the HDMI cable is not being pulled down while connecting to the camera. The power cable is on the right side.}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/mic_box.jpg}
    \caption{This shows the box which the mic setup is connected to. In the image, the mic is plugged into port 5, which would correspond to channel 5 on the sound board.}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/soundboard_power.jpg}
    \caption{This shows the power box for the sound board. The laptop is plugged into the front power port, and both the power button at the top and bottom are in the on position.}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./img/zoom_window.png}
    \caption{This shows the camera view as seen through the zoom window. Notice that the bottom of the camera view is aligned with the table and the microphone is in the center. This lets the podium and speaker take up approximately one third of the screen (following the rule of thirds) so that it is the focal point. In this particular case, the ``Journey'' sign in the top left is a bit more visible than desired. Zooming in slightly more than this is okay.}

    \caption{This shows a sample VLC window which displays 5 hymns and special music (selected). Notice that the music is paused at the end of the special music. This is because the music will auto-pause immediately after finishing.}

    \caption{This shows the soundboard. In this display, the main volume (right side, black knobs) is turned up to a normal level, the computer audio is turned up slightly (middle, white knobs), and the podium mic (left, channel 5) is turned up. This shows the small number of channels we usually use for our setup.}
