# Bible Notes (LaTeX)

This project is a personal Bible study tool built in LaTeX, designed for structured verse-by-verse annotation and commentary.

## Overview

- Organizes content by book, chapter, and verse
- Allows custom inline markers for referencing
- Supports categorized notes (e.g., historical, translation, context, etc.)
- Automatically handles verse numbering and note formatting
- Ensures clean visual separation between verses and notes

## Purpose

Designed to support detailed and flexible Bible study, allowing notes and reflections to be attached directly to specific words or phrases in the text.

## Usage
