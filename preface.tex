\chapter{Preface}
\thispagestyle{fancy}

This project is a personal undertaking to rewrite and annotate the Holy Bible for study, reflection, and understanding. The primary text used throughout is the \textit{New King James Version (NKJV)}, though other translations may occasionally be referenced where clarity, variation, or historical interest requires. Each book of the Bible is treated as a separate chapter, and each begins with a brief summary outlining its themes or narrative structure.

\tab The scripture is presented verse by verse using a custom format that allows for inline references and annotations. These annotations include (but are not limited to) historical background, translation notes, literary and cultural context, scientific references, theological or reflective questions, and general comments. Each of these various types are also color-coded for ease of reference/reading. They are marked inline with a custom symbol (e.g., \vmark{*}) and collected directly below the verse for easy association.

\tab This is an ongoing and evolving project. At the time of writing this preface, it is highly incomplete and is being developed incrementally. As updates, corrections, and expansions are made, the version number of the document will be incremented accordingly. This allows for tracking progress and identifying updated material across future iterations. This work is intended for personal study and is freely shareable for non-commercial purposes.

\subsection*{Note Types and Symbols}

The following is a list of annotation types used throughout this work. Each note is marked with a specific icon and color to indicate its category and purpose:

\contextnote{Context}{Highlights the literary, narrative, or cultural context of a passage, aiding in its interpretation and situational relevance.}	
\sciencenote{Science}{Connects the passage to scientific ideas, natural phenomena, or the relationship between scriptural content and modern science.}	
\questionnote{Question}{Poses theological, philosophical, or reflective questions raised by the verse, encouraging deeper thought and study.}	
\generalnote{Note}{A general-purpose note for observations, clarifications, or commentary that doesn't fall into one of the above categories.}
