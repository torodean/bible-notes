1) Often companies spend more money on the advertising than the actual products to create a false need in individuals. This is like how satan creates a false desire to sin.

	- Advertisements try to keep your attention
	- Michael kizinski Stanford - with 10 FB likes/pages we can tell aspects of your personality better than coworkers, 150 better than mom, 300 better than average spouse.
	- FB knows how long you hover over things, what you click on, how long you've hovered over, what you've shared, who you've stalked and for how long, etc.
	- FB is a vast questionaire we're constantly filling out.
	- As humans, we are persuadeable.
	- Satan uses his schemes to keep our attention because they work just like advertising.
	- It draws us in with what we like.

	- This guy is bad because he's a nazi and tortured jews. No, he was raised to torture jews, he was trained and conditioned to torture jews. If you were trained and conditioned as he was, would you have tortured jews? How do you know going through living in someone elses shoes that you would make better decisions? You don't.
	
2) The seven churches of Revelation were all around at the same time. They were all still the church, part of the church etc. But, they all had things needing changed just as we do in our church. We embody what the seven churches are and need to recognize it exists among us.

4) Colossians 3:12-17

5) II Timothy 4:1-5. "Be ready in season, and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, WITH LONGSUFFERING!!!!" With patience. Slowly. Don't force people to an answer. When we teach it should be through example. We need to leave everlasting marks on others and not bombard them with ideas they will simple dismiss.
	
6) Connecting The Parable of the Lost Sheep in Mathew 18:10-14 with Mathew 18:15-20. The lost sheep contrasted with a lost brother. The brother is a sheep. By sinning against you he is lost and so this is giving you a way to lead him back.

7) The pristige. “Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called "The Pledge". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called "The Turn". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call "The Prestige".”

8) Gabor Mate on addiction. James 1:12-18

9) Tree's create helicopters, but how do they have any idea about their seeds after dumping them? Evolution or design?

10) Trauma. This is something I learned from Gabor Mate. When a Traumatic experience occurs, we often think that is the thing that we hold to, that is the thing that is our trauma. In contrast though, usually we don't discuss that experience when it occurs or at least until many years later. THAT is the actual trauma... The feeling of being alone, and not having someone to talk with. That is the true trauma, and that event would have had such an impact if we had someone to discuss it with. This parallels a lot with God and him providing you a place to open up everything. It also closely relates to parenthood and our duties and responsibilities.

11) When lambs get separated from their mother, the mother may completely reject the baby lambs. This causes them to butt them away and refuse to take care of them. Sometimes the person we rely on the most, the people who are the most important to us, may abandon us. And this could be (not literally, but indirectly) because the shepherd wants to take care of us. The shepherd wants to form that intimate bond with us and take care of us. God is our shepherd who wants this, but we are also suppose to be shepherds looking around us for lost lambs.

12) Don't be surprised when you send your kids to Ceasar and they return at Romans...
    - Deuteronomy 6:6–7
    - Ephesians 6:4 
    - Proverbs 22:6
    - Colossians 2:8 
    - Psalm 78:5–7
    - Romans 12:2
    - Isaiah 54:13
    - 2 Timothy 3:14–15
    - The Romanization metaphor is apt: Roman values were taught not just in schools but through the entire culture—art, language, law, ritual. Likewise, today’s cultural formation (media, curriculum, peers) shapes children unless there is intentional counter-formation rooted in Scripture and modeled at home.
    - Parents often attempt to intervene once problems appear, but Scripture emphasizes early, consistent, and proactive training (Prov. 22:6, 2 Tim. 3:14–15). It’s about building a resilient identity in Christ before the world tries to define one.
    
13) Rescue mission from the feast as an example. True love is to give ones life for another. But ones life is our time, our energy, our comforts, our posessions... do we live like this?!?
