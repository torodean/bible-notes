Throughout my messages, I've often mentioned the concept of perspective and how it affects what we see, think, and understand. I'm not going to explicitly discuss \textit{perspective} in this message, but it does form a large basis for the foundation of what I will focus on - so keep it in mind. Instead, I'm going to discuss \textit{doom and gloom}. Starting with the definition, doom and gloom can be defined as 

\begin{quotation}
	``a feeling or attitude that things are only getting worse." \cite{Dictionary}
\end{quotation}

There are two distinct prevailing thoughts I've regularly heard about this topic. The first is that we have far too many \textit{doom and gloom} messages. In contrast, the second is that we \textit{don't} have too many and we could potentially use some more.

	``But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchmanâ€™s hand." - Ezekiel 33:6
