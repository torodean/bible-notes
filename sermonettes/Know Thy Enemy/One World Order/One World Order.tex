A classic and well known `conspiracy theory` is that society is leading down a path which will inevitably lead to a \textit{one world government}. Other names for this may be a \textit{New World Order}, \textit{Global State}, \textit{Beast Power}, or more. Any bible scholar knows that this is not a `conspiracy', but rather something prophesied in Revelation - where the entire world will be under a single Beast Power which has authority over every tribe, tongue, and nation\footnote{Revelation 13:7 - ``It was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, tongue, and nation.''}. The Bible teaches that there will be a time where everyone, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave will not be able to buy or sell without a \textit{mark} of the beast power\footnote{Revelation 13:16-17 - ``He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, 17. and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.''}. This is a concept that was discussed often back during the days of the \textit{World Wide Church of God}\footnote{The immediate audience for this message is the \textit{United Church of God} (UCG), which was a continuation of the original beliefs of the \textit{World Wide Church of God} from the previous century. Most of the audience in UCG would be aware of this.}, but is not a topic I've heard discussed or talked about in recent times. Perhaps it's because most of us are well aware of this - but one thing I've never heard explored is the \textit{why}. \textit{Why} does Satan want a One World Government? \textit{Why} does he push society towards a Beast Power?

Obviously, as humans, we cannot fully know the mind or motives of God, Satan, or any other being (angels, demons, or even other people). However, we can often understand \textit{plausible} reasons behind actions to make sense of them. This is one way of understanding the \textit{why} behind actions and a way of understanding why Satan wants a One World System. Simply put, a One World System is a counterfeit to Divine Sovereignty - it will transform Satan to `be like God.'

\begin{quotation}
For you have said in your heart:
`I will ascend into heaven,
I will exalt my throne above the stars of God;
I will also sit on the mount of the congregation
On the farthest sides of the north;
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,
\textit{I will be like the Most High}.' - Isaiah 14:13-14
\end{quotation}

One of Satan's ultimate goals is to \textit{be like the Most High}.

\begin{quotation}
``Am I a God near at hand,'' says the Lord,
``And not a God afar off?
Can anyone hide himself in secret places,
So I shall not see him?'' says the Lord;
``Do I not fill heaven and earth?'' says the Lord. - Jeremiah 23:23-24
