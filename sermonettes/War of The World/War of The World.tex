On September 10, 2025, Charlie Kirk was assassinated in front of a massive audience. A book titled \textit{The Shooting of Charlie Kirk}, by Anastasia J. Casey was discovered on Amazon very shortly after the incident. It's not easy to write an entire book in less than a day - let alone publish and post the book. People who found this quickly turned to AI as the explanation. However, the strangest part was that the book had an Amazon listing and publication date of September 9, 2025; just one day \textit{before}. How? How does a book get published one day \textit{before} the actual incident? 

I verified this personally, but of course if you were to go look this up now, the date has been 'corrected'. The explanation for this is actually \textit{probably} quite simple. Someone did use AI to write the book. How else could you write the book so fast? But more than that, someone had likely published a book the day before the incident (September 9), and then \textit{updated} the title and cover image on the Amazon listing \textit{after} the event - so that it would seem like it was written before! That seems like a great way to draw attention to your listing - a perfect marketing strategy. But, how can we know what really happened? 

Last week, I read a UCG article about red heifers and the third temple. Apparently, on August 15, there was an article published titled “Secret Red Heifer Sacrifice Performed in Israel After Public Was Told It Was Only a ‘Practice’”. Allegedly, the leaders swapped out a flawless and Biblically pure red heifer named Tikva and carried out the first real sacrifice in over 2000 years - preparing the way for the third temple to be built. But, how can we really know? If this is true, can we verify it?

If you've ever listened to the news, you may realize how completely out of touch they are. You may see how the stories they present are always completely exaggerated, twisted and embellished. Over the past few weeks, I've seen countless internet posts about history itself being completely fabricated. One claim going around is that the mathematical limit to how many Jews could have died during the Holocaust is only around 270,000, and the 6 million figure we've been taught is propaganda. How do we know? I can read my history books, but I wasn't there. If you look at how current events are portrayed, or even read about the recent COVID events which affected all of us, you can see that modern history isn't accurate; so why should we believe other history is? 

There's a common saying that the military is about 50 years ahead of technology that's publicly available. If that's the case, then how do we know AI hasn't been perfected for years - and perhaps they (the overloaded they meaning some group in power) only want us to think it's just now reaching such a state? How do we know?

You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.  - Mathew 24:6

--------------------------
























How many of us have been at war? Have you (the reader) been in a war before?

\begin{quotation}
Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. - Ephesians 11-12
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God... - 2 Corinthians 10:3-4
\end{quotation}

We are all at war. We are in a spiritual war. This isn't a war against our physical bodies - although that's not excluded. This is a war after our very souls. This is one of the most fundamental concepts of the Bible. We are at war with the rulers of darkness of this age; against the \textit{spiritual} hosts  of wickedness. This is a war greater than any other throughout history. This is a war waged against humanity from the beginning of time.













\begin{quotation}
Observe Israel after the flesh: Are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? 19 What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what is offered to idols is anything? Rather, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have fellowship with demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lord’s table and of the table of demons. Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He? - 1 Corinthians 10:18-22
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
They provoked Him to jealousy with foreign gods;
With abominations they provoked Him to anger.
They sacrificed to demons, not to God,
To gods they did not know,
To new gods, new arrivals
That your fathers did not fear. - Deuteronomy 32:16-17
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. - Mathew 6:24
\end{quotation}

AI says ""Annuit cœptis" translates to "He [God] favors our undertakings," while "Novus ordo seclorum" means "A new order of the ages." "

\begin{itemize}
\item BRAINSTORMING
\item How do we worship God? We simple live by his word. We keep his commandments and live like him. We don't have to shout on the rooftops. Likewise, how do we worship demons? We simply live in their ways. What we do in silence shows who we worship. So when I hear people say "I see a lot of good people around, some of the nicest people I know are the Gay or transgender, or others of a sinful lifestyles"... Did Satan come to Eve as a kind friend? Or a ruthless beast? He came as a calm, collective, trusting friend. To serve demons does not mean you become a beast.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
\item Why do all cultures throughout history tend towards the same things? The same sins? The same abominations, etc?
\item We have the capabilities of being a great people, a thriving people - why do we not? We have the resources and technology. Yet we do not. Star Trek is the only series which kind of dives into this idea. We have the money - all the money spent on WW2 could have put a hospital and school in every town on the planet.
\end{itemize}
