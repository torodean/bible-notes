% Intro paragraph can maybe be removed - just here to outline my initial thought of how I'm ordering this message.
In this message, I'm going to very briefly touch on three related concepts and demonstrate how important and beneficial they are when put into practice in every day life; Mindset, Value, and Perspective (MVP for those who remember acronyms well). %I will do this in reverse order to demonstrate how each of these builds on another. I'll do this while also telling a story which occurred during this past feast. This story will also be in reverse order - hopefully it's clear why when finished.

\subsection*{Perspective}

During this past Feast{The Feast of Tabernacles was just about a week out at the time of writing this message.}, there was one day which left a memory a bit different than the others. Me and my Wife were staying with my little brother and my dad - it was the first time she had met them in person (since we live so far away). She was of course a tad concerned that maybe she wouldn't be able to stand them for that long; after all, many of us know how families can be. I don't think that was a problem, but nonetheless we made sure to schedule a date-night during the Feast where we could get away as just as us two.

Neither of us are very big on doing a lot of planning, so for the most part we were just going to wing it. This was a Friday going into the beginning of the Sabbath day. By the end of the day, it wasn't that late yet, but we ended up coming home pretty early. We both decided it had been a long day/Feast and we should just head back and relax and not do anything else. Just before heading home, we had went out to my wife's favorite restaurant that she had been talking about almost nonstop before we got to the area. We almost didn't even end up going and we ended up eating rather quickly while there. I had decided to skip dessert - even though I had previously decided that was the Feast day I was going to splurge and get one. The food was good, but overall we weren't there long. 

Just before the restaurant, we went to Home Depot. What better place to spend a date night than Home Depot? I bought myself some new tools and a few supplies and we spent a while out in the parking lot trying them out. Before Home Depot, we stopped at a car wash. I fairly recently got a new (used but still new to me) truck, and I've never washed it before. We ended up leaving because they only took change and I didn't actually have any on me. Shortly before that, we were back at our temporary dwelling (AirBnB) prepping for our date night that evening. My wife took a quick nap after church and I spent some time chatting with my little brother. An obvious question proceeds this story - What kind of a date night is that?!

\begin{quotation} % Perspective
``My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience.'' - James 1:2-3
\end{quotation}

I intentionally left out one key detail of that story to demonstrate the importance of perspective. It should sound like that was a pretty \textit{dull} and \textit{peculiar} date-night. As we left to head out on our date night, we had originally planned to head straight to the restaurant as our first stop. It was a little over a half-hour drive. Around one of the long 35 mile-per-hour Tennessee curves, things went from normal to chaos in the blink of an eye. Glass was everywhere, my newly installed rear-view towing mirror was dangling by a wire, and the first thing out of my wife's mouth was ``Did you hit him or he hit you?'' The answer surprised her, ``It was a deer.'' A deer had launched itself directly into my driver side window - it's face only inches from mine for a split-second.


\subsection*{Mindset}

When this happened, my initial reaction was to prioritize. My heart-rate was high, and I was a little shaky. I had to formulate a plan. My priorities were the following: clean up the glass, patch the window, and then get us to the restaurant. 

\begin{quotation} % mindset
``For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a \textit{sound mind}.'' - 2 Timothy 1:7
\end{quotation}

\subsection*{Value}

\begin{quotation} % value
``But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. ''
\end{quotation}
